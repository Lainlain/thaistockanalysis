### Open Analysis
<p>**Thai Stock Market Morning Analysis: September 30, 2025**

The SET Index opened the morning session at 1286.26, marking a slight dip of 1.81 points. Despite this cautious start, market sentiment appears to be driven by selective buying interest rather than broad-based momentum. Key drivers include specific corporate news and anticipation of upcoming economic data, with investors carefully picking stocks demonstrating robust fundamentals or strong catalysts.

Sector performance exhibits a divergent trend. Large-cap leaders, indicated by highlights such as +68, +61, +64, +69, +62, +65, are showing significant positive movements, likely driving the overall market's stability. Concurrently, mid-cap or growth-oriented stocks, seen with +20, +23, +26, +28, +21, +24, also demonstrate healthy buying interest, suggesting pockets of strength in specific high-growth or consumer-related sectors.

From a technical perspective, the SET's opening at 1286.26 places it near immediate support levels. Should this level hold, the market could see a rebound towards a near-term resistance in the 1290-1295 range. Conversely, a sustained break below 1280 might signal further downside pressure, indicating increased caution is warranted for the intraday session.

Given the selective nature of current buying, we recommend a focused trading strategy. Investors should consider accumulating quality stocks on dips, particularly those with strong earnings outlooks or clear positive catalysts. Maintain vigilance on market breadth and monitor global market developments for potential shifts in sentiment.</p>


### Close Set
* Close Index: 1280.38 (-7.69)

### Close Summary
<p>Morning session closed at 1280.38 (-7.69) after lost 5.88 points from 1286.26 opening. **Thai Stock Market Morning Session Summary (2025-09-30)**

The SET index commenced the morning session on a weak footing, opening lower and extending its decline to close at 1280.38, down 5.88 points from its opening. This marks a continued negative trend, with bearish sentiment firmly in control throughout the session as the index failed to find any significant buying support.

Key drivers appear to be a persistent lack of fresh positive catalysts and ongoing concerns, possibly stemming from global economic uncertainties or domestic slowdown fears. Profit-taking also contributed, as investors reduced exposure amidst a risk-off sentiment, leading to sustained selling pressure.

From a technical perspective, the consistent downward movement points to further weakness, with the index likely to test crucial support levels around 1275-1270 in the afternoon. Investors should maintain a cautious stance, closely monitor these technical levels, and consider holding off on new positions until clearer market direction emerges.</p>

## Afternoon Session

### Open Set
* Open Index: 1279.48 (-8.59)
* Highlights: **+94 +97 +90 +93 +95 +98 +91 <br><br>+84 +87 +80 +83 +86 +89 +82**

### Open Analysis
<p>**Thai Stock Market Afternoon Session Analysis: September 30, 2025**

The Thai stock market opened the afternoon session on a cautious note, with the SET Index at 1279.48 points, reflecting an 8.59-point decline from the previous close. This initial dip suggests prevailing concerns, likely stemming from a combination of global economic uncertainties and domestic factors such as inflation outlook or corporate earnings expectations for Q3. Investors appear to be exercising prudence amid these headwinds, leading to profit-taking in some segments.

Despite the broader market's cautious stance, specific individual counters are attracting significant buying interest, as indicated by the strong performances in the `+94, +97, +90, +93, +95, +98, +91` and `+84, +87, +80, +83, +86, +89, +82` highlight groups. While not specific sector codes, these represent select mid-to-small cap stocks showing resilience or driven by specific positive catalysts. This suggests a "stock-picking" environment, with investors focusing on companies with solid fundamentals, unique growth stories, or those benefiting from specific thematic plays like domestic consumption recovery or export-driven momentum, rather than broad-based sector rallies.

From a technical perspective, the SET Index faces immediate resistance around the 1285-1290 point level. Should the selling pressure intensify, the 1270-1275 range could serve as the next support zone. The market is currently consolidating, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction, and is likely to remain range-bound in the near term. Momentum indicators suggest a slight bearish bias, but with potential for short-term rebounds on positive news flow.

Given the mixed signals, investors are advised to maintain a selective approach. Focus on companies with strong balance sheets and clear growth prospects that are less sensitive to macro fluctuations. Risk management remains crucial; consider partial profit-taking on strong rallies and accumulate quality stocks on significant dips. For broader market exposure, a wait-and-see approach might be prudent until clearer trends emerge.</p>
